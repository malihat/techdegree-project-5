# Public API Requests 
This project was build using API. The data used was requested using an API. A random user generator API was used to list 12 employees in a grid. By clicking the employee’s image, the modal window is opened and more detailed information about the user will be available. I have changed the background color and added box shadow to the modal. I used jQuery with some javascript for this project. 

## Skills and techniques required to complete the project 
I used fetch method to retrieve data from the API. The data was then used to display in the DOM. A fetch returns a promise and we use .then function to get the data. It is part of asynchronous javascript, which is a non-blocking feature so the other code does not stop.
